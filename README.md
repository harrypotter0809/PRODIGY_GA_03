**TITLE : TEXT GENERATION WITH MARKOV CHAINS**

What is a Markov Chain?

A Markov chain is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another, where the probability of transitioning from one state to another is dependent on the current state and time elapsed. The future state of the system is determined solely by its current state, and not by any of its past states.

In simple words we can say it is a way to model a system that can be in different states, and can change from one state to another. The next state depends only on the current state, not on what happened before.
